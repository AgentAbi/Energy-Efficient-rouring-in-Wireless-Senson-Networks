Overview

This project focuses on designing energy-efficient routing algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to extend their operational lifetime. WSNs consist of numerous sensor nodes that communicate wirelessly to transmit data to a central sink node. Due to limited battery power in these nodes, optimizing energy consumption is crucial for maintaining network functionality and avoiding issues like network partitioning and the energy hole problem.

Problem Statement

In WSNs, nodes close to the sink node tend to deplete their energy faster due to the higher volume of data they handle, leading to non-uniform energy consumption and network partitioning. This imbalance hinders the network's performance, reducing its lifetime and efficiency. The challenge lies in balancing energy consumption while ensuring reliable and real-time data delivery to the sink node. The goal is to develop a routing algorithm that identifies the most energy-efficient path from the source to the sink, thereby maximizing the residual energy of the network and prolonging its lifetime.

Objectives

Energy Consumption Balancing: Distribute energy usage evenly across all nodes to prevent rapid depletion of any single node.
Load Balancing: Ensure data traffic is evenly spread to avoid overburdening certain nodes.
Shortest Path Selection: Choose the shortest path to minimize energy consumption while maintaining efficient communication.
Reducing Packet Retransmission: Minimize retransmissions to save energy, considering packet reception rates.

Proposed Methodology

Two distinct algorithms were explored to address the problem: the heuristic-based A-star algorithm and the probabilistic Simulated Annealing algorithm.

A-Star Algorithm

The A-star algorithm is known for finding the optimal path in a graph. It combines the actual cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to the goal. This algorithm is advantageous in WSNs due to its ability to quickly converge to an optimal solution when provided with a reasonable heuristic.

Heuristic Calculation: The heuristic function estimates the cost to reach the sink node, considering factors like distance and average neighbor distance.

Cost Function: The algorithm evaluates nodes based on residual energy, packet transmission rate, and buffer capacity, balancing these factors to select the most energy-efficient path.

Pathfinding: The algorithm iteratively selects the best node to traverse, updating energy consumption for each transmission and reception, and ultimately constructs the optimal path from source to sink.

Simulated Annealing

Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum in a large search space. It's particularly useful in scenarios where traditional algorithms might struggle due to the complexity and size of the network.

Initial Path Generation: A random path from the source to the sink is generated, ensuring connectivity.

Path Variation: The algorithm randomly modifies segments of the path to explore different routes.

Energy Evaluation: Each new path is evaluated based on its energy consumption. The algorithm probabilistically accepts or rejects new paths to avoid local optima and explore a diverse set of solutions.

Temperature Control: The "temperature" parameter gradually decreases, reducing the probability of accepting worse solutions over time, thereby focusing on local optimization in the later stages.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of two advanced algorithms to address the critical challenge of energy-efficient routing in WSNs. By balancing energy consumption and load while ensuring efficient data transmission, the proposed methods aim to significantly extend the network's operational lifetime. The A-star algorithm provides a quick and optimal solution for smaller networks, while Simulated Annealing offers a robust approach for larger and more complex networks, effectively navigating the trade-offs between energy efficiency and quality of service.
